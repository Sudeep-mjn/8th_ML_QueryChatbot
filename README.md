**Abstract**
This project presents the development of an intelligent chatbot designed to assist users with queries related to machine learning, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Utilizing the Flask framework in Python, the chatbot aims to provide quick and efficient access to datasets covering essential machine-learning topics. The primary objective is to enhance the user experience by offering accurate and detailed explanations, automating information retrieval, and allowing users to focus on more complex tasks. By providing a user-friendly interface, the chatbot serves as a valuable educational tool for researchers, data scientists, and students, facilitating their understanding and application of machine learning in various contexts

quiz portion is from the quiz part, and training.py is used to train the data.json containing different ml topics data
